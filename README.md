# MyFinances

This a simple web application allowing you to see polish stock prices, details about the stock and save single stock in a favorites list.

## Purpose

MyFinances was created as a part of a project for a class at university. The main aim of the project was to implement as many Software Design Patterns as we can.

Design patterns included:

- Adapter - wraps an external fake API
- Singleton - stores user credentials globally
- Command - invokes buttons pressed in another place
- Facade - hides database services implementation
- State - changes the content of the object with details info
